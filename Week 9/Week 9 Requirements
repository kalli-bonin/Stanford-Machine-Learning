This week's focus was Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems - you can find the files assigned in the following list:
	estimateGaussian.m - Estimate the parameters of a Gaussian dis- tribution with a diagonal covariance matrix
	selectThreshold.m - Find a threshold for anomaly detection
	cofiCostFunc.m - Implement the cost function for collaborative fil- tering
