This week's focus was Linear Regression - you can find the files assigned in the following list:
	plotData.m - Function to display the dataset
	computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression
	gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent
	computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables
	gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables
	featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features
	normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations
