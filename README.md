# Stanford-Machine-Learning

This repository includes all my coursework from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course available on Coursera. You can view my course completion certificate at https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/NQG4F42PBHBH.

Each week had a programming assignment that would apply that weeks knowledge, usually applying a machine learning algorithm to a data set using Matlab.

I look forward to applying this learning to a real life situation on my next coop term from May-August 2019. If you would like to chat about advice for my next steps in machine learning, internship opportunities or all things robotics, reach out to me on LinkedIn or email me at kalli_bonin@yahoo.com
